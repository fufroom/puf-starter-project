# Puf - PHP ultralight framework
## Starter Project

Puf is a **minimalist PHP framework** designed for simplicity, speed, and ease of use. It eliminates the bloat of traditional frameworks by using **flat JSON files instead of databases**, **magic link authentication instead of passwords**, and **straightforward routing and templating**.

This starter project includes a **fully functional Todo app** as an example of how to use Puf.


## üéØ The Base Todo App

To help you get started, this is a simple Todo app that showcases:

    Dynamic routing (GET /todos/{id})
    JSON file storage (Each Todo is a separate file)
    Basic CRUD operations (Create, update, delete Todos)
    Bootstrap-based UI
